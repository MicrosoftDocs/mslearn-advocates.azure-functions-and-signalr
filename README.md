# SignalR with Azure Functions triggers and bindings

This repository is the companion to the following training module:

* [Enable automatic updates in a web application using Azure Functions and SignalR Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/automatic-update-of-a-webapp-using-azure-functions-and-signalr/)

This solution displays fake stock prices as they update: 

* Start: uses polling every minute
* End: uses database change notifications and SignalR

## Set up resources

The Azure resources are created from bash scripts in the `setup-resources` folder. This includes creating:

* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure SignalR
* Azure Storage (for Azure Function triggers)

## Ports

* Client: 3000: built with webpack
* Server: 7071: build with Azure Functions core tools

## Starting project without SignalR

The starting project updates stock prices in a Cosmos DB database every minute with an Azure Function app and a timer trigger. The client polls for all the stock prices. 

## Ending project

The starting project updates stock prices in a Cosmos DB database every minute with an Azure Function app and a timer trigger. The client uses SignalR to recieve on the Cosmos DB items with change notifications through an Azure Functions app. 

## Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions App

1. Deploy the backend to Azure Functions App.

    GitHub Action workflow file should look like:

   ```yaml
    # Docs for the Azure Web Apps Deploy action: https://github.com/azure/functions-action
    # More GitHub Actions for Azure: https://github.com/Azure/actions
    
    name: Build and deploy Node.js project to Azure Function App - signalr-3
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
      workflow_dispatch:
    
    env:
      PACKAGE_PATH: 'server-end' # set this to the path to your web app project, defaults to the repository root
      AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH: '.'
      NODE_VERSION: '20.x' # set this to the node version to use (supports 8.x, 10.x, 12.x)
    
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: 'Checkout GitHub Action'
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
          - name: Setup Node ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }} Environment
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    
          - name: 'Resolve Project Dependencies Using Npm'
            shell: bash
            run: |
              pushd './${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}/${{ env.PACKAGE_PATH}}'
              npm install
              npm run build --if-present
              npm run test --if-present
              popd
    
          - name: Zip artifact for deployment
            run: |
              pushd './${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}/${{ env.PACKAGE_PATH}}'
              zip -r ../release.zip .
              popd
            
          - name: Upload artifact for deployment job
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: node-app
              path: release.zip
    
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: build
        environment:
          name: 'Production'
          url: ${{ steps.deploy-to-webapp.outputs.webapp-url }}
        permissions:
          id-token: write #This is required for requesting the JWT
    
        steps:
          - name: Download artifact from build job
            uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
            with:
              name: node-app
    
          - name: Unzip artifact for deployment
            run: unzip release.zip
          
          - name: Login to Azure
            uses: azure/login@v1
            with:
              client-id: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_CLIENTID_7953CE71DA404164BBBC35F07ECDD4FD }}
              tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_TENANTID_853880B11FFD4142A37B35F0DBD5C55D }}
              subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZUREAPPSERVICE_SUBSCRIPTIONID_3B05BF95EF5440AF941C3AECF9FF10CD }}
    
          - name: 'Run Azure Functions Action'
            uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
            id: fa
            with:
              app-name: 'signalr-3'
              slot-name: 'Production'
              package: ${{ env.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH }}
   ```
   


1. Deploy the frontend to Azure Static Web Apps in Standard plan type (not free) in order to use [bring your own backend](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/functions-bring-your-own) (byob).

    Workflow file should include this section:

    ```yaml
    name: Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
      pull_request:
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
        branches:
          - main
    
    jobs:
      build_and_deploy_job:
        if: github.event_name == 'push' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed')
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Build and Deploy Job
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              submodules: true
              lfs: false
          - name: Build And Deploy
            id: builddeploy
            uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
            with:
              azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_LIVELY_BUSH_0E5550C0F }}
              repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for Github integrations (i.e. PR comments)
              action: "upload"
              ###### Repository/Build Configurations - These values can be configured to match your app requirements. ######
              # For more information regarding Static Web App workflow configurations, please visit: https://aka.ms/swaworkflowconfig
              app_location: "/client-end" # App source code path
              api_location: "" # Api source code path - optional
              output_location: "dist" # Built app content directory - optional
              ###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
    
      close_pull_request_job:
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'closed'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: Close Pull Request Job
        steps:
          - name: Close Pull Request
            id: closepullrequest
            uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
            with:
              azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_LIVELY_BUSH_0E5550C0F }}
              action: "close"
    ```

    BYOB doesn't rely on the `api_locaton` property to find the APIs. Once linked, you can access the Functions App `api` endpoints through the api path from your static web app. This means the client doesn't have to know the backend URL because it uses its own URL for that purpose. 

## Troubleshooting

Log an issue and @mention the [`javascript-docs`](https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/teams/javascript-docs) team. 

### Codespaces troubleshooting

* If the request from the client is refused by the serverless app, and you have CORS correctly configured in `local.settings.json`, change the visibility of the 7071 port from `private` to `public` for testing purposes only. This should allow the client to find the server in Codspaces.
