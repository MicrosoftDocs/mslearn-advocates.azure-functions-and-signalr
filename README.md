# SignalR with Azure Functions triggers and bindings

This repository is the companion to the following training module:

* [Enable automatic updates in a web application using Azure Functions and SignalR Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/automatic-update-of-a-webapp-using-azure-functions-and-signalr/)

This solution displays fake stock prices as they update: 

* Start: uses polling every minute
* End: uses database change notifications and SignalR

## Set up resources

The Azure resources are created from bash scripts in the `setup-resources` folder. This includes creating:

* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure SignalR
* Azure Storage (for Azure Funciton triggers)

## Ports

* Client: 3000: built with webpack
* Server: 7071: build with Azure Functions core tools

## Starting project without SignalR

The starting project updates stock prices in a Cosmos DB database every minute with an Azure Function app and a timer trigger. The client polls for all the stock prices. 

## Ending project

The starting project updates stock prices in a Cosmos DB database every minute with an Azure Function app and a timer trigger. The client uses SignalR to recieve on the Cosmos DB items with change notifications through an Azure Functions app. 

## Troubleshooting

Log an issue and @mention the [`javascript-docs`](https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/teams/javascript-docs) team. 

### Codespaces troubleshooting

* If the request from the client is refused by the serverless app, and you have CORS correctly configured in `local.settings.json`, change the visibility of the 7071 port from `private` to `public` for testing purposes only. This should allow the client to find the server in Codspaces.
